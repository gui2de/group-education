## Policy Issue: 

- High social stigma and the low provision of menstrual hygiene products can be a significant impediment for girls’ access to education in Sub-Saharan Africa (Benshaul-Tolonen et al., 2020). This is a prevalent issue in Uganda whereby 65% of girls and women lack the resources and support to meet their menstrual health needs (Surge, 2024).
- This can have severe impacts on their education, whereby one-quarter of secondary school girls drop out of school after they begin menstruating (Surge, 2024). 
- Whilst the challenges and consequences of low menstrual health provisions are understood, there is a lack of data and understanding of the impacts of good menstrual hygiene practices and resources in Sub-Saharan Africa (Anbesu & Asgedom, 2023), especially regarding the impacts of social stigma.

## Policy Proposal 

- We propose a policy intervention to study the impacts of providing sanitary products and interventions to reduce social stigma through educational workshops. We propose having two treatments and a control group. 
    - Treatment 1: Provision of hygiene products 
    - Treatment 2: Provision of hygiene products and educational workshops led in schools 
    - Control group: No intervention 

## Theory of Change Outline: 

- Inputs:
    - Provision of sanitary napkins and hygiene products
    - Training sessions for school teachers on periods, hygienic practices, and how to teach this information to female and male students. 

- Activities:
    - Design and implement educational workshops in schools
    - Facilitation of peer-to-peer conversations about menstrual health in schools

- Output:
    - Increase girls' and boys’ understanding of what a period is and why it is natural and healthy 
    - Ensure that girls know how to deal with monthly bleeding 
    - Reduce social stigma around menstruation among girls and boys
    - More trust circles for girls to talk about menstruation

- Outcome
    - Girls don’t drop out of school when period starts 
    - Increased school attendance by girls during their period
    - Reduced stress around periods and better focus in class 

- Impact: 
    - Higher learning outcomes from increased attendance 
    - Increased female empowerment (better understanding of their bodies and reduced stigma)
