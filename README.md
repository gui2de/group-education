## Literature Review 
Menstrual hygiene management among adolescent girls in West Africa: A systematic review (Tomlinson, M. et. al. African Journal of Reproductive Health, Jan 2024) 
This systematic literature review conducted to examine all recent academic, peer-reviewed studies of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) across adolescent girls in Anglophone West Africa finds: <br>
* On an average age of menarche between 12-15 years old among adolescent girls <br>
* Less than half of the adolescent girls knew about menstruation before menarche. Many studies showed that girls were shocked by their first period and fearful of staining. <br>
* Menstruation was associated with dysmenorrhea, fear/embarrassment, and missing school.<br>
* There's a need for more implementation and evaluation of menstrual hygiene management materials, education, and facilities are needed to address the educational, physical, and social disparities that exist among girls in West African countries. <br>

This comparative study examines the impact of menstruation on the lives of schoolgirls in Ghana, Cambodia and Ethiopia. It finds: <br>
* Challenges to adolescent management of menses with privacy and dignity include inadequate water, sanitation and disposal facilities, and insufficient guidance to help girls feel confident in attending school during menses. <br>
* The focus included girls’ school participation; their relationship with parents, teachers and peers; their evolving sanitation and hygiene needs; their understanding of cultural issues and taboos around menses; and what education, if any, they received prior to and during puberty. <br>
* Similarities regarding the importance of culture in perpetuating negative attitudes towards menstruation, limited provision of health information and insufficient facilities within schools. <br>
* Differences were revealed regarding menstrual myths, parent–child dynamics, sources of guidance and student–teacher relations. <br>
* There is a critical knowledge gap around menstruation and girls’ education in these contexts that must be addressed to ensure that girls experience a positive menarche and can manage menstrual hygiene.<br>

* Intervention: training teachers to improve delivery of government guidelines for puberty education, training in use of a menstrual kit and pain management, a drama skit, provision of analgesics and improvements to school water and sanitation hygiene facilities <br>
* Results: The proportion of girls reporting anxiety about next period decreased from 58.6% to 34.4%, and reported use of effective pain management increased from 76.4% to 91.4%.<br>
* A cluster randomised trial is needed to evaluate rigorously the intervention effects on MHM and school attendance.

## Sample 
- Secondary schools in Poro and Bagoue: 52 schools total 
- Of the total of schools of Poro, 50% are treated
- Of the total of schools of Bagoue, 50% are treated

## Data Collection 

### Timeline and Frequency
* Baseline data collection: One month before intervention implementation
* Midline data collection: At the end of each school term (3 times per year)
* Endline data collection: Two years after baseline

### Data Sources: Primary Outcome Measures
1. School Attendance Records
    * Daily attendance data from official school registers
    * Separated by gender and reason for absence when available

2. Student Surveys (Pre and Post Intervention)
    * Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to menstruation for all students (both genders)
    * Self-reported school attendance during menstruation
    * Psychological well-being measures (confidence, stress, anxiety)
    * Product usage and satisfaction (treatment groups only)
    * Social dynamics and perceived stigma around menstruation
    * Ability to focus in class during menstruation


## Policy issue: 

- Low provision of menstrual hygiene products and lack of understanding of what periods are/ how to prepare for them is a significant impediment for girls’ access to education in Sub-Saharan Africa (Benshaul-Tolonen et al., 2020). 
- This can have severe impacts on their education, whereby one-quarter of secondary school girls drop out of school after they begin menstruating (Surge, 2024). 
- Whilst the challenges and consequences of low menstrual health provisions are understood, there is a lack of data and understanding of the impacts of good menstrual hygiene practices and resources in Sub-Saharan Africa (Anbesu & Asgedom, 2023).

## What issues exist regarding menustration and girls' education: 

- Menstruation poses significant challenges to girls' education in Sub-Saharan Africa through multiple mechanisms:

    1. Resource constraints: research from UNICEF (2022) shows that common reasons girls and women held back from school were due to a lack of access to menstrual hygiene products were common factors. 
        - This is an acute issue in Côte d'Ivoire, with little exisiting research done in the country. Within the country, period poverty affects approximately 61% of women and girls, with many unable to afford proper menstrual products (The Borgen Project, 2023). In northern Côte d'Ivoire, it was found that only 10% of schools have adequate hygiene facilities (Kouakou et al., 2021), creating significant barriers to school attendance during menstruation. 

    2. Lack of understanding and awareness of periods before their first cycle, which can affect their perception and understanding of menstruation (UNICEF, 2022). This can affect girls' education through different channels: 
         - Psychological impacts (stress, anxiety, reduced confidence)
         - Social dynamics (fear of teasing, isolation from peers)
       
## How these issues affect girls' education 

The effects of inadequate menstrual health knowledge and resources manifest in multiple ways:

1. Direct impact on school attendance 
- Regular absenteeism during menstruation periods
- In Ethiopia, it was found that 58% of girls report declined school performance post-menarche (Tegegne et al., 2014) and 52% of girls miss school due to fear of teasing (Tegegne et al., 2014)

2. Learning Environment Effects (Macours et al., 2024)
- Increased stress and anxiety during menstruation
- Reduced concentration in class
- Isolation during menstruation
- Negative impacts on the overall school social environment

### Persistence Factors

These issues surrounding the impact of menustration on girls' education persist due to several interconnected factors:

1. Economic Barriers
- cost of sanitary products relative to household incomes
- limited availability of cheap/alternative options 
- competing household financial priorities

2. Social and Educational Barriers
- insufficient awareness about proper menstrual hygiene
- limited knowledge transfer within families 
- inadequate school provision for menstrual management in terms of teacher and resource support

## Intervention design
- To be delivered at the school level 
- schools will be selected so that they are in different geographic locations and there is no spillover between kids outside of school time (e.g., socially or school commute time)
- random selection of schools to receive treatment A and random selection of schools to receive treatment B, these schools should be comparable at baseline
- to be delivered to school year group of form 3 with girls of age 14-15

## Intervention Delivery with potential risks
- purchase products 
- ensure sanitary prodcuts are distributed to treatment schools 
- ensure sanitary products are distributed by teachers to students (risk: sanitary products don't reach intended beneficiaries i.e., female students)
- training sessions to teachers teaching in schools that are in treatment arm B (risk: teachers don't attend or engage with training session properly meaning they do not deliver effective workshops)
- trained teachers then deliver workshops once per term to female students at schools in treatment arm B (risk: female students do not attend workshops)
- collect data on school attendence of female students in each intervention arm (risk: school attendance data is unreliable or inaccurate or not collected to the same extent between different schools participating in the study)

## Key Outcome Measures 
- Overall school attendance: Measured as percentage of total school days attended per term meaured by school data on student attendance 
- Survey on female studnet understanding and perception of period to be carried out pre and post intervention to all intervention groups


### Policy Proposal: addressing different barriers through different treatement arms

#### Setting: Côte d'Ivoire
Our intervention design targets both practical and social barriers in public schools in Cote d'Ivoire: 

1. Treatment A: Product provision only 
- Addresses immediate resource constraints
- Enables basic menstrual management at school
- Tests the impact of removing practical barriers alone
- Expected treament effect for treatment A: 7-10% reduction (i.e., reduce to ~22.5%) 

2. Treatment B: Mixed intervention: product provision and workshops
- Combination product provision with educational workshops to be delivered to female students only 
- Addresses both resource and social barriers
- Expected treament effect for treatment B: 8%-12% reduction 

3. Control: no intervention

- all schools will be randomly selected public schools with comparable baseline characteristics 

### Expected/anticiapted mechanisms of change given the existing literature:

1. Direct impacts
- access to sanitary products ->  increased attendance since girls don't have to worry about bleeding in public
- increaesd knowledge and understanding -> better understanding of what a period is, why it is natural and what to expect 

2. Indirect impacts
- Peer education through the workshops -> change social norms
- Teacher training ->  more supportive learning environment


## Theory of Change Outline: 

- Inputs:
    - Provision of sanitary napkins and hygiene products
    - Training sessions for school teachers on periods, hygienic practices, and how to teach this information to female and male students. 

- Activities:
    - Design and implement educational workshops in schools
    - Facilitation of peer-to-peer conversations about menstrual health in schools

- Output:
    - Increase girls' and boys’ understanding of what a period is and why it is natural and healthy 
    - Ensure that girls know how to deal with monthly bleeding 
    - Reduce social stigma around menstruation among girls and boys
    - More trust circles for girls to talk about menstruation

- Outcome
    - Girls don’t drop out of school when period starts 
    - Increased school attendance by girls during their period
    - Reduced stress around periods and better focus in class 

- Impact: 
    - Higher learning outcomes from increased attendance 
    - Increased female empowerment (better understanding of their bodies and reduced stigma)
